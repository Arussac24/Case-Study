          <h2>Project Overview</h2>  
          <p>Arts For All is a new New York City based non-profit organization 
            curated with the intention to connect children with socio-economic 
            barriers to several artistic opportunities.
            
            Although they had a great organization, their web presence needed
            a facelift. We set out to bring Arts for All into the year 2022.</p>  
          <h2>Roles</h2>
          <p>As the Project Manager, it was my job to organize tasks in detailed
            order, and dictae what each person on my  team was responsible for 
            with given deadlines.</p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>In the Research stages of our Design process our team followed
          qualitative research and design thinking methodologies to compare 
         and contrast the insights we gathered. As a result we completed
          8 user interviews based on user's past experiences with non-profit 
         organizations.</p>

      <h2>Arts For All</h2>
      <p>Before Arts For All can achieve their goals of gaining more supporters
        donations, and recognition for their outstanding community 
        involvement, Arts For All needs an informative, aesthetically 
        pleasing, and easier to use website and mobile application</p>
